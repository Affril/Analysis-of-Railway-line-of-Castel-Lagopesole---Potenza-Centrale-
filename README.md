### Analysis_of_Railway_line_of_Castel_Lagopesole_Potenza_Centrale 
#### To determine the maximum allowed speed
#### To determine the length and schematically draw the horizontal transition curves (cubic
parabola) between curves and straight sections taking into account the following
hypothesis.
#### To determine the length and schematically draw the vertical circular transition curves
between the couples of slopes taking into account the following hypothesis.
#### To determine departure and arrival times from/to the stations of the section, for both
directions, by assuming a minimum 10% additional (buffer) running time.
#### To determine the commercial speed of the resulting service in both directions.
#### To determine the T-V curves of diesel train-set DMU Class 150 and Electric train-set TAF.
#### To position Main Signals (MS) and Advance Signals (AS) to protect stations and level crossing (LC) all considered automatically controlled.
#### To plan the doubling of the track and correspondingly position track circuits (optionally signals) and balizes for operating with ERTMS.
#### To calculate the minimum headway between two trains running in the same direction and the bidirectional capacity by using the UIC 405 method 
#### Station routes schematization, occupation and interdiction times
#### To formulate an operational plan, by assigning flows of trains to routes, balanced by lines and directions, starting from the traffic hypothesis adopted for the line.
##### To calculate regular and total utilization rates by the following formulations (Potthoffmethod)
##### To increase the balanced flows by route, take the corresponding variations of the utilization rates to finally reach the capacity of the station, according to thresholds of utilization rates to be fixed.
